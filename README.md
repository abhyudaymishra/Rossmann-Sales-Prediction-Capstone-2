**Problem Statement and Project Description**

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

**ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis**

The observation that most stores are closed on Sundays suggests that this day is not a major shopping day for most consumers. The relationship between sales and customers appears to be nearly linear, meaning that as the number of customers increases, sales will likely increase as well. However, the presence of positive skewness in sales data suggests that some products or stores may be underperforming, which could be dragging down overall sales. This can have important implications for businesses, as it may indicate a heavy reliance on high-performing products or stores, or the need to improve the performance of underperforming ones to achieve better sales outcomes.
It is essential for businesses to analyze their sales data regularly to identify patterns and trends that can help them make informed decisions. By understanding the relationship between sales and customers, businesses can tailor their marketing and sales strategies to attract more customers and increase sales. Additionally, identifying the products or stores that are underperforming can help businesses focus their efforts on improving those areas, rather than relying solely on their high-performing areas. This can lead to a more balanced and sustainable business model, reducing the risk of relying too heavily on any one product or store. In summary, regularly analyzing sales data can provide valuable insights that can help businesses make informed decisions to improve their overall performance.
